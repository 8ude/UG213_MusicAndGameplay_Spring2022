ASSIGNMENT 8 - Musical Walking Sim 2 
------
**(Due Monday, Apr 18 at 3 pm Eastern)**

Expand on the soundscape in your prototype from last week - try to add as much interactive as possible within the context of a walking simulator (you can add some simple interaction if you'd like, emphasis on _simple_!). Challenge yourself to make the music even more detailed and interactive - this could mean adding additional layers, utilizing effects and transitions, or experimenting with things like randomization and day-night cycles.

As usual, post a build to itch.io and leave some comments for your design critique partner!

ASSIGNMENT 7 - Musical Walking Sim 1 
------
**(Due Monday, Apr 11 at 3 pm Eastern)**

Modify the template project Proteusque (you can also start from scratch, but keep it a walking simulator!) to make it your own audio-visual landscape.

You must replace the music with your own! It should have three separate "sections" corresponding to different parts of the map. It does not need to be as complicated as the existing music (you can remove the spatialized loops) but there should be three distinct areas.

In addition, try to incorporate one or two of the following:
- change up the landscape! You can use whatever modeling/texturing/rendering method you'd like. Make a landscape inspired by your music!
- Add more audio-reactive animations - either elements responding to the beat, or responding to volume. See the video from March 28 if you need a refresher on how to do this with Wwise
- Experiment with more complex interactive music - add randomized or aleatoric elements, make branching paths and more complex "vertical" arranging

As always, make a build and post it to itch.io


MIDTERM PROJECT
------
**(Due Monday, Apr 4 at 5 pm Eastern)**

Make a music game!

ASSIGNMENT 6 - Rhythm Game Prototype 2 
------
**(Due Monday, Mar 21 at 3 pm Eastern)**

You have 2 weeks due to Spring Break

Once again, either modify the existing rhythm game template in Wwise/Unity, or create your own prototype from scratch. Try to Utilize MIDI beatmaps, and make some changes in the visual feedback if you haven't already. 

We looked at some rhythm games that incorporate narrative elements, or have diegetic cues (rhythm heaven cues feel like they're "in the game world"). How could you make these in Unity with the framework provided?

Once again, aim for a minute of gameplay, upload your prototypes to itch, make sure comments are enabled so others can leave feedback

ASSIGNMENT 5 - Rhythm Game Prototype 1 
------
**(Due Monday, Mar 7 at 3 pm Eastern)**

Either modify the existing rhythm game template in Wwise/Unity, or create your own prototype from scratch (you can use the clock script from the sound toy if you wish to work exclusively in Unity). At a minimum, try to change the following things:

- replace the music. this can be your own original music or something you find from an external source. Be sure to give credit and obtain permission if you're distributing your game publically.
- create a beatmap for about 1 min of gameplay. aim for something approachable, as if it were a first or second level, and try to abstract the rhythm of the music into something simple.
- remap the controls in a way that makes sense for your game.

upload your prototypes to itch, make sure comments are enabled so others can leave feedback


ASSIGNMENT 4 - Sound Toy Prototype 3 
------
**(Due Monday, Feb 28 at 3 pm Eastern)**

Make a 3rd and final sound toy prototype. Again, this can either be an extention of your sound toy from last week, or something new. I encourage you to experiment with rhythm, either by using the clock tool or coming up with your own way to make rhythms.

As before, give some feedback to your design critique partner on their itch page.


ASSIGNMENT 3 - Sound Toy Prototype 2 
------
**(Due Monday, Feb 14 at 3 pm Eastern)**

As with last week, make a sound toy prototype (you can work alone or in pairs again). This can either be an extention of your sound toy from last week, or something new.

If you work on improving your sound toy from last week, try to incorporate other types of sound (for example, in-engine synthesis) or different ways of producing sound (if you used a lot of momentary collision sounds, maybe try continuous sounds)

Additionally, give some feedback to your design critique partner on their itch page

Windows/Mac Uploads to itch.io are preferred (please try to build both Windows and Mac versions) - if you make it password protected, be sure to drop that in the Slack.

ASSIGNMENT 2 - Sound Toy Prototype 1 
------
**(Due Monday, Feb 7 at 3 pm Eastern)**

Working alone or in pairs, make a sound toy prototype.  You can either make a mod of the example project or start from scratch.

At the least, put your own sounds into the Sound Toy.  Think about visual improvements / themeing - this could be more abstract (like panoramical) or more literal (like biophilia). Maybe start with some new sounds, and see what kind of world they invoke.

Windows/Mac Uploads to itch.io are preferred (please try to build both Windows and Mac versions) - if you make it password protected, be sure to drop that in the Slack.

ASSIGNMENT 1 - CRITICAL PLAY
------

Choose a music game ([here's a list - please sign up on the tab that says "sign up sheet"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14mBE0D4OONFe5WcpYIexCtgGP8hsAjTXgIp4Bi0yM6U/edit?usp=sharing)) and play it for at least 2-3 hours. Some are available in the library, check with Gwynna or a librarian for the best time to try it out. 

Prepare a few slides on the game, including some representative gameplay footage. This could be your own capture or from Youtube. 

Graduate students - at least 2 slides should be a diagram of how gameplay and music are inter-connected.

Plan your presentations to be between 5 and 10 min

[Here's an example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CggJ1078_SK6u3FUuh_zdi21taIblNFtIIb4zXcU5p8/edit?usp=sharing) of a diagram for a rhythm game

[The manual for electroplankton](https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/gameslist/manuals/DS_Electroplankton.pdf) is full of sound toy diagrams

We're going to have 3 'show-and-tell' days, one for each broad category of music game:

 - Sound Toys: February 7

 - Rhythm Games: March 7

 - Synesthetic/Hybrid Games: April 4

So, for example, if you pick ElectroPlankton, a sound toy, you will need to present your slides on Monday, February 7th

On these days we will use your critical play studies to examine how music can be informed by gameplay (and vice versa).
