ASSIGNMENT 2 - Sound Toy Prototype 1 (Due Monday, Feb 7 at 3 pm Eastern)
------

Working alone or in pairs, make a sound toy prototype.  You can either make a mod of the example project or start from scratch.

At the least, put your own sounds into the Sound Toy.  Think about visual improvements / themeing - this could be more abstract (like panoramical) or more literal (like biophilia). Maybe start with some new sounds, and see what kind of world they invoke.

Windows/Mac Uploads to itch.io are preferred (please try to build both Windows and Mac versions) - if you make it password protected, be sure to drop that in the Slack.

ASSIGNMENT 1 - CRITICAL PLAY
------

Choose a music game ([here's a list - please sign up on the tab that says "sign up sheet"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14mBE0D4OONFe5WcpYIexCtgGP8hsAjTXgIp4Bi0yM6U/edit?usp=sharing)) and play it for at least 2-3 hours. Some are available in the library, check with Gwynna or a librarian for the best time to try it out. 

Prepare a few slides on the game, including some representative gameplay footage. This could be your own capture or from Youtube. 

Graduate students - at least 2 slides should be a diagram of how gameplay and music are inter-connected.

[Here's an example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CggJ1078_SK6u3FUuh_zdi21taIblNFtIIb4zXcU5p8/edit?usp=sharing) of a diagram for a rhythm game

[The manual for electroplankton](https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/gameslist/manuals/DS_Electroplankton.pdf) is full of sound toy diagrams

We're going to have 3 'show-and-tell' days, one for each broad category of music game:

 - Sound Toys: February 7

 - Rhythm Games: March 7

 - Synesthetic/Hybrid Games: April 4

So, for example, if you pick ElectroPlankton, a sound toy, you will need to present your slides on Monday, February 7th

On these days we will use your critical play studies to examine how music can be informed by gameplay (and vice versa).
