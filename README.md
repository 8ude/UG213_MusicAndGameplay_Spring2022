# UG213_MusicAndGameplay_Spring2022
üéº Spring 2022 Repository for the Class Music and Gameplay üïπÔ∏è

ASSIGNMENT 1 - Rhythm Game Prototype 1 
------
**(Due Monday, Mar 7 at 3 pm Easter)**

Either modify the existing rhythm game template in Wwise/Unity, or create your own prototype from scratch (you can use the clock script from the sound toy if you wish to work exclusively in Unity). At a minimum, try to change the following things:

- replace the music. this can be your own original music or something you find from an external source. Be sure to give credit and obtain permission if you're distributing your game publically.
- create a beatmap for about 1 min of gameplay. aim for something approachable, as if it were a first or second level, and try to abstract the rhythm of the music into something simple.
- remap the controls in a way that makes sense for your game.

upload your prototypes to itch, make sure comments are enabled so others can leave feedback


ASSIGNMENT 4 - Sound Toy Prototype 3 
------
**(Due Monday, Feb 28 at 3 pm Eastern)**

Make a 3rd and final sound toy prototype. Again, this can either be an extention of your sound toy from last week, or something new. I encourage you to experiment with rhythm, either by using the clock tool or coming up with your own way to make rhythms.

As before, give some feedback to your design critique partner on their itch page.


ASSIGNMENT 3 - Sound Toy Prototype 2 
------
**(Due Monday, Feb 14 at 3 pm Eastern)**

As with last week, make a sound toy prototype (you can work alone or in pairs again). This can either be an extention of your sound toy from last week, or something new.

If you work on improving your sound toy from last week, try to incorporate other types of sound (for example, in-engine synthesis) or different ways of producing sound (if you used a lot of momentary collision sounds, maybe try continuous sounds)

Additionally, give some feedback to your design critique partner on their itch page

Windows/Mac Uploads to itch.io are preferred (please try to build both Windows and Mac versions) - if you make it password protected, be sure to drop that in the Slack.

ASSIGNMENT 2 - Sound Toy Prototype 1 
------
**(Due Monday, Feb 7 at 3 pm Eastern)**

Working alone or in pairs, make a sound toy prototype.  You can either make a mod of the example project or start from scratch.

At the least, put your own sounds into the Sound Toy.  Think about visual improvements / themeing - this could be more abstract (like panoramical) or more literal (like biophilia). Maybe start with some new sounds, and see what kind of world they invoke.

Windows/Mac Uploads to itch.io are preferred (please try to build both Windows and Mac versions) - if you make it password protected, be sure to drop that in the Slack.

ASSIGNMENT 1 - CRITICAL PLAY
------

Choose a music game ([here's a list - please sign up on the tab that says "sign up sheet"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14mBE0D4OONFe5WcpYIexCtgGP8hsAjTXgIp4Bi0yM6U/edit?usp=sharing)) and play it for at least 2-3 hours. Some are available in the library, check with Gwynna or a librarian for the best time to try it out. 

Prepare a few slides on the game, including some representative gameplay footage. This could be your own capture or from Youtube. 

Graduate students - at least 2 slides should be a diagram of how gameplay and music are inter-connected.

Plan your presentations to be between 5 and 10 min

[Here's an example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CggJ1078_SK6u3FUuh_zdi21taIblNFtIIb4zXcU5p8/edit?usp=sharing) of a diagram for a rhythm game

[The manual for electroplankton](https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/gameslist/manuals/DS_Electroplankton.pdf) is full of sound toy diagrams

We're going to have 3 'show-and-tell' days, one for each broad category of music game:

 - Sound Toys: February 7

 - Rhythm Games: March 7

 - Synesthetic/Hybrid Games: April 4

So, for example, if you pick ElectroPlankton, a sound toy, you will need to present your slides on Monday, February 7th

On these days we will use your critical play studies to examine how music can be informed by gameplay (and vice versa).
