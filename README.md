ASSIGNMENT 1 - CRITICAL PLAY
------

Choose a music game ([here's a list - please sign up on the tab that says "sign up sheet"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14mBE0D4OONFe5WcpYIexCtgGP8hsAjTXgIp4Bi0yM6U/edit?usp=sharing)) and play it for at least 2-3 hours. Some are available in the library, check with Gwynna or a librarian for the best time to try it out. 

Prepare a few slides on the game, including some representative gameplay footage. This could be your own capture or from Youtube. 

Graduate students - at least 2 slides should be a diagram of how gameplay and music are inter-connected.  Here's an example of that with a Sound Toy, and here's one with a music game.

We're going to have 3 'show-and-tell' days, one for each broad category of music game:

Sound Toys: February 7
Rhythm Games: March 7
Synesthetic/Hybrid Games: April 4

So, for example, if you pick ElectroPlankton, a sound toy, you will need to present your slides on Monday, February 7th

On these days we will use your critical play studies to examine how music can be informed by gameplay (and vice versa).
